# Wrangling and Analyze Data
## By Marzuk Sulemana

## Dataset
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.

## Tools
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

## wrangle_act
This IPYNB contain the entire process of wrangling and analysis of the dataset.
## wrangle_report
This document represents the report of the wrangling performed on the dataset. I carried out visual and programmatic assessment on the three datasets and detected quality and tidiness issues. I then took the necessary steps to clean them before the analysis.

## act_report
